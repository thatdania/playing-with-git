# Playing with Git & GitHub #

This was an introduction to Git and GitHub to understand what they are and how they work.
This was on Makers Academy's precourse and was done during Week 1.

It was understanding the differences between git and github. It was also 
learning the steps to apply a change and send it out to github.
